The projects for graduate level course CFD II

- Project I : A Control-Volume-Based Finite Element Methods is used to solve the incompressible flow on a Lid-driven cavity. This is an implementation of https://doi.org/10.2514/3.12700

- Project II : Roe method is used to solvecompressible Euler equations on unstructured grids
