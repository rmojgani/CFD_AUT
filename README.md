# Amirkabir University of Technology, Department of Aerospace Engineering, Course project: CFD II
The projects for graduate level course CFD II

- Project I : A control-volume-based finite element method is used to solve the incompressible flow (in a lid-driven cavity). This is an implementation of https://doi.org/10.2514/3.12700

- Project II : Roe's Riemann solver is used for compressible Euler equations on unstructured grids (flow on an airfoil)
